# GraphMate

GraphMate is a web application designed to assist blind individuals in understanding graphical data through sound. This project utilizes Flask for the backend, OpenAI for natural language processing (NLP), and takes audio input using the Speech-to-Text function in JavaScript to generate sound output based on interpreted equations.

## Features

- **Auditory Graph Interpretation:** Convert audio input into descriptive audio representations of graphical data.
- **NLP Integration:** Leverage the power of OpenAI's NLP to interpret spoken equations.
- **Interactive Exploration:** Allow users to interact with and explore graphs using keyboard shortcuts or voice commands.
- **Speech-to-Text:** Utilize the Speech-to-Text function in JavaScript for converting spoken input to text.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **NLP:** OpenAI API
- **Graph Processing:** Function Developed using Python
- **Audio Processing:** TextToSpeech-Python
- **Speech-to-Text:** JavaScript
